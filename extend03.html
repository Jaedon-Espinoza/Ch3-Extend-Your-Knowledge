            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>It is important to use discriptive file names for image files to have better orginazation if you have a ton of photos. It can also help for when you are searching for a photo as it would make it easier to find and put into your code. This allows for less mistakes in your code and saves you time.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Adobe to change the size of the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image in pixels was 2121 x 1414.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand wrtiting HTML 5 on glass" height="326" height="450">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used the image compressor from tinyjpg.com to reduce the file size. This changed the photo's file size from 27KB to 22KB.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand wrtiting HTML 5 on glass" height="326" width="450">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>One major thing that I notice is that despite having both images at the same height and width the html5_min.jpg is smaller than the html5.jpg. Another thing that I noticed is that the html5_min.jpg is a little more blury than the hmtl5.jpg.</p>

                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
               
                <svg width="300" height="130">
                        <rect width="50" height="100" x="5" y="5" rx="10" ry="10" style="fill:red;stroke:yellow;stroke-width:10;opacity:1" /> 
                </svg>
                         
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used the w3schools website to read about the different SVGs you can put using HTML. I leared about how to add them in and how to add borders and and opacity to the shapes that I choose.</p>
